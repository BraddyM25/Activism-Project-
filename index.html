  <p> The question of why students decide not to compost at times, can go back to many general reasons that we have seen in the past: composting by hand can be very tedious, finding an area to compost near your community is difficult to find, separating the compost from the trash efficiently, and having to deal with the odor of the compost. All of these issues can be seen as huge impacting factors on peoples' decision whether or not they would like to compost. </p>
